My name's Alexander.
I'm from Blagoevgrad.
I like to play football, watching MMA fights, going out clubs with my friends, like to drive a lot.
I choosed SoftUni because a lot of marketing going on around them everybody is talking either good or bad. I read a lot on forums, groups and decided to see for myself if it is true or not.
